Be aware of the different behaviours of ´git checkout´.

´git checkout <filename>´ or ´git checkout <hash>´ overwrites <filename> with the file from the staging area or latest commit or in the latter case, *all* files from the commit corresponding to <hash>

´git checkout <branchname>´ switches to the branch of that name (no overwriting).
